# Kanye-Has-Faced-Criticism-
Kanye West has faced a backlash from others in the black community for his support for President Trump, including a visit to the White House last week. We want to hear from our readers of color about their own experiences with having political views that donâ€™t align with what their community expects.

If you, like Kanye, are a person of color who supports the Trump administration and are feeling pressure or even hostility from your peers, tell us about it.

A reporter may contact you to hear more, or your submission may be selected for publication.
